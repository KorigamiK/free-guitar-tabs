# Free-guitar-tabs-downloader

### This is a tool to download guitar tabs from various artists having various songs. 

    1. The tabs are free as provided by their respective creators.

   2. You can see the folders of artists in the code of this repo. Run the python/ any other language programs by installing the required dependencies to get a new list of links.

   3. You can use the links that are already made inside the folders but beware that they may be outdated.

   4. You can use tools such as [Jdownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) to batch download the tab files.

   5. To contribute you can create a pull request with a new folder with the name of the artist and the current `links.txt`, the program file or any other required file.

   6. Do not upload the actual files for the tabs! Write a cloud link to download from inside your `links.txt` if you wish to do so.

I hope you enjoy playing the tabs.
